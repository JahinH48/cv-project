                                <p>If you hope to become a web developer, you must understand HTML and CSS. HTML is the
                                    most used markup language across the web, and web developers use it to create web
                                    pages on the Internet. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style the website. It's
                                    responsible for the choice of fonts, colors and layout in a website's design.
                                    Whereas HTML lays the foundation for a webpage, CSS styles it.</p>

                                <h3>Analytical skills </h3>
                                <p>As a web developer, you'll need to have keen analytical skills to create a variety of
                                    successful websites. This involves ensuring the coding is correct so the website is
                                    functional. Also, it's important to understand the needs of your customers or
                                    clients. You'll need to analyze their wants and needs and be ready to adapt to any
                                    changes they'd like to see implemented on the website. The better you understand
                                    your client, the better your website will turn out for them in the end.</p>

                                <h3>Responsive design skills</h3>
                                <p>If you work as a web developer, it's important to understand how responsive design
                                    works. Because many people view webpages both online and on their mobile devices,
                                    the websites you create need to adapt to the changing screen sizes. If your website
                                    isn't responsive, this means it won't be compatible with either the desktop site or
                                    the mobile site. In other words, it won't function or show up properly on either of
                                    these platforms. Your ability to create a responsive design can also impact the
                                    number of visitors a website gets since most people are deterred from a website when
                                    it's not displaying properly.</p>
